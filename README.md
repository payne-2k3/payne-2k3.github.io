# **2ktellyaid blog**
2ktellyaid - movie/tv show database project by Adam McKeown and Philip Leonard.

In short, more or less a documentation of code, progress, et al, in regard to progress to our project. Nothing too fancy. There will be more to add to it 
Anyways, here's a picture from the IT Crowd to show that we can link images and such. Might be helpful for screenshots of our project. The content is immature (albeit a little endearing), but at the same time, mainly to show a test image.

- Blog is created on *github.io* following advice from our project supervisor, Ellen Rushe. Admittedly, there were a few things to take care of initially (*mainly in learning in how to deploy the blog*). It seems pretty nifty that this is doable on standard github!

- User registration and login features are implemented courtesy of Adam. Beforehand, he had created a series of backend test cases, while also implementing the feature comments and a trending media page. During this time, Adam also kept an eye out on the database side of things.

## 05/02/25
- A database comprised of different tables (using models.py) is created. Within models.py, each structured class links up with a respective table within said database. These same tables were created based on the outstanding code we had. Adam was responsible for creating the database with the tables, noting that they weren't populated. It's during this time that we decide to ask our project supervisor, what the best way would be to populate each of the tables. We planned on calling these tables from the front-end, and subsequently creating a UI around it.
- Following this meeting... ...
