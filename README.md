# **2ktellyaid blog**
2ktellyaid - movie/tv show database project by Adam McKeown and Philip Leonard.

In short, more or less a documentation of code, progress, et al, in regard to progress to our project. Nothing too fancy. There will be more to add to it 
Anyways, here's a picture from the IT Crowd to show that we can link images and such. Might be helpful for screenshots of our project. The content is immature (albeit a little endearing), but at the same time, mainly to show a test image.

- Blog is created on *github.io* following advice from our project supervisor, Ellen Rushe. Admittedly, there were a few things to take care of initially (*mainly in learning in how to deploy the blog*). It seems pretty nifty that this is doable on standard github!
